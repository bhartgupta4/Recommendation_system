# Recommendation_system

An attempt has been made to analyze the interactions on articles on the IBM Watson Studio, and make recommendations to them about new articles.

Enviroment: Using jupyter notebooks,python 3
Libraries used:
1 Pandas
2 Numpy
3 Matplotlib
3 Scikit learn
5 Pickle

## Project is divided into different parts
Part I. Exploratory Data Analysis
Data is explored to extract relationship between various variables using statistical and visualizatin tools

### Part II. Rank Based Recommendations
Here there is extraction of top rated articles simply on the basis of interaction by all the users

### Part III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
Relation between different users is extracted and receommendation is made according to the relation as in users are recommended aticles that similar users have interacted with

### Part IV. Matrix Factorization
Here we have made use of user_item matrix using latent features and have tried to form three matrices the user-latent feature matrux, the latent -latent feature matrix and the article latent feature matrix and their interaction is used to recommend articles.

## Result
Using all these measures we can build a recommendation system.
